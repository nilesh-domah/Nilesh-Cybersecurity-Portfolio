# Vulnerability Management using Nessus
## Project Description
- [x] Installed and configured Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed vulnerability scans against Window 10 Hosts
- [x] Implemented Vulnerabilty Management Function on sandbox networks:
  - Discover, Prioritize, Assess, Report, Remediate, Verify 
- [x] Conducted vulnerability assessments with Nessus; remediated vulnerabilities
- [x] Developed automated remediation process to preemptively deal with vulnerabilities stemming from Windows updates and third-party software

_Vulnerability management is continuously assessing your assets to discover vulnerabilities, remediating them to an acceptable risk, and iterating the process over and over again to make sure the risk in the whole organization is low or at an acceptable level._

## Walkthrough
1. Do scan in Nessus against virtual machine (VM)
  - Get IP address from VM, disable firewall, then ping VM from physical machine
  - VM IP Address: 10.0.0.129

2. Setup VM to be able to accept authenticated scans, and give Nessus credentials
  - In Services, enable Remote Registry
  - In User Account Control Settings, turn off notifications for computer changes
  - In Registry Editor, add a key to further disable user account control for the remote account

3. Perform credentialed network scan in Nessus

Most vulnerabilities can be easily solved by automatic updates and patches. 

4. Download an old version of (Firefox)[https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/3.6.12/win32/en-US/] on the VM and run the scan again (we should expect numerous vulnerabilities).

To remediate, we need to uninstall Firefox and update Windows.

5. Run the scan again

## Future Considerations
In the future, I would like to expand on this project by fixing more remediations and maybe do an alterantive project running Windows XP instead of Windows 10.
